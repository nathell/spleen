Welcome to Spleen, a Scrabble playing engine written in Clojure.

Currently, it is in a very early stage of development.  However, most
of the game logic (including move lookup) is already in place.  It
currently supports Polish Scrabble, but support is planned for other
word games -- as a minimum, Scrabble and Literaxx (see
http://www.playok.com/en/literaxx/) in both Polish and English
variants will be available for play.   

Other planned features:
  * a GUI
  * support for the proprietary Official Polish Scrabble Dictionary
    (OSPS)
  * human-like AI behaviour including psychological profiles

To try it out, you will need a dictionary, available at
http://korpus.pl/~nathell/pl-dict.fsa.  Spleen also uses my
clj-bitfields library that you can find on GitHub.
